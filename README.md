# Forward-Propagation
Implement the forward propagation algorithm for a simple neural network with one hidden layer. The neural network has the following specifications: 1. Input layer with 3 features 2. Hidden layer with 4 units, using the ReLU activation function 3. Output layer with 2 units, using the softmax activation function
